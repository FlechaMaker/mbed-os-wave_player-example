# wave_player example for Mbed OS 5.11

This example demonstrates how to use [wave_player library](https://os.mbed.com/users/sravet/code/wave_player/) in Mbed OS 5.11.
The program loads `.wav` files from SD card and plays them.

This project is a fork of [Mbed OS file system exmaple](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-filesystem).

## NOTE

Mbed OS and [wave_player library](https://os.mbed.com/users/sravet/code/wave_player/) are modified from their original to use the wave_player library written for Mbed OS 2.
